Notes from my Stone River eLearning course:  Python Programming for Beginners
The course covers Python 3.4, but I'm working in version 3.7.
I have used a lot of free resources, so why not give back in the little way that I can? Maybe someone could benefit from these. 
I have used Spyder3 to write the code, which I accessed from the Anaconda navigator.
